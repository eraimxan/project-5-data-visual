# 3D Model Processing with Open3D

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive 3D model processing pipeline using Open3D library in Python. It performs various operations on 3D models including point cloud conversion, surface reconstruction, voxelization, plane clipping, and extreme point detection.

## Features
- **7-Step Processing Pipeline**: Complete workflow from loading to advanced analysis
- **Multiple Format Support**: PLY, STL, OBJ, OFF, GLTF, GLB formats
- **Advanced 3D Operations**: Surface reconstruction, voxelization, plane manipulation
- **Visual Analytics**: Gradient coloring, extreme point detection, interactive visualization

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Open3D
- NumPy

## Installation
```bash
pip install open3d numpy
